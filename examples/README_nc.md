[NOAA Obspack](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/obspack/) is a collection of
green house gases observations

`rtorf` only depends on `data.table` and `ncdf4`, which is basically
parallel C, so it can be installed in any machine.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("noaa-gml/rtorf")
```

``` r
library(rtorf)
library(data.table)
```

## ObsPack summary

The first step consists in constructing a summary for the ObsPack. This
is required to read the data, but also, identify `agl`, which is present
in some of the file names. This function returns a `data.frame`.
Optionally, the user can indicate a path to store the `data.frame`.
`obs_summary` also prints a summary of the data. The second argument is
the categories, and by default includes the categories shown below, to
account for all the files. Then the summary `data.frame` contains the
columns `id` as the full path to each file, `name` which is the name or
relative path of the file, `n` just an id, `sector` such as tower, and
the column `agl` which indicates the `agl` indicated in the name of the
file if available. To read the documentation of this function, the user
must run `?obs_summary`.

> We first define the categories

``` r
cate = c("aircraft-pfp",
         "aircraft-insitu",
         "aircraft-flask",
         "surface-insitu",
         "surface-flask", 
         "surface-pfp",   
         "tower-insitu",  
         "aircore",       
         "shipboard-insitu",
         "shipboard-flask") 

obs <- "Z:/torf/obspack_ch4_1_GLOBALVIEWplus_v5.1_2023-03-08/data/nc/"
index <- obs_summary(obs = obs, categories = cate)
```

    ## Number of files of index: 429
    ##               sector     N
    ##               <char> <int>
    ##  1:     aircraft-pfp    40
    ##  2:  aircraft-insitu    15
    ##  3:    surface-flask   106
    ##  4:   surface-insitu   174
    ##  5:   aircraft-flask     4
    ##  6:          aircore     1
    ##  7:      surface-pfp    33
    ##  8:     tower-insitu    51
    ##  9:  shipboard-flask     4
    ## 10: shipboard-insitu     1
    ## 11:    Total sectors   429
    ## Detected 190 files with agl
    ## Detected 239 files without agl

## Implementation in python:

I’m currently implementing a version in python:
