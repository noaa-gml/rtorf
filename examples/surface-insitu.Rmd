```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(rtorf)
library(data.table)
```


```{r read1, eval = T}

cate = c("aircraft-pfp",
         "aircraft-insitu",
         "aircraft-flask",
         "surface-insitu",
         "surface-flask", 
         "surface-pfp",   
         "tower-insitu",  
         "aircore",       
         "shipboard-insitu",
         "shipboard-flask") 

obs <- "Z:/obspack/obspack_ch4_1_GLOBALVIEWplus_v5.1_2023-03-08/data/nc/"
index <- obs_summary(obs = obs, 
                     categories = cate)
```


Now we read the `surface-insitu` using the function `obs_read_nc`. 
`solar_time` is  included for surface, so we `TRUE` that argument.

```{r readnc, eval = T}
datasetid <- "surface-insitu"
df <- obs_read_nc(index = index,
                  categories = datasetid,
                  solar_time = TRUE,
                  verbose = TRUE)

```

Now we check the data

```{r checkdf, eval = T}
df
```



Now we can process the data. We first filter for observations
within our spatial domain:

## Checks and definitions

```{r spatial, eval = T}
north <- 80
south <- 10
west <- -170
east <- -50
max_altitude <- 8000
yy <- 2020
evening <- 14

```

We check altitude, intake_height, altitude_final and elevation.
altitude_final is a column from intake_height, added to match
column from obs_read text files.

```{r checkcols, eval = T}
df[, c("altitude", "altitude_final", "intake_height", "elevation",
       "dataset_selection_tag",
              "site_name")]
```

The temporal range of data is
```{r range_year, eval = T}
range(df$year)
```


We also check for dimensions of data

```{r dim_df, eval = T}
dim(df)
```

## Filters

```{r spatial_temporal_filter, eval = T}
df <- df[year == yy]

df <- df[altitude_final < max_altitude &
           latitude < north &
           latitude > south &
           longitude < east &
           longitude > west]
dim(df)
```


After filtering by space and time, we have `r round(nrow(df), 2)`
million observations. Towers can have observations at different
heights. Here we need to select one site with the observations
registered at the highest height. The column
with the height is named `altitude_final` and the
max altitude was named `max_altitude`.


```{r}
dfa <- df[,
          max(altitude_final),
          by = site_code] |> unique()

names(dfa)[2] <- "max_altitude"
dfa
```




### Key Time

Here we need to start time columns.
The function `obs_addtime` adds time columns
`timeUTC`, `timeUTC_start` which shows the start time
of each observation and `timeUTC_end`
which shows the end time for each observation.


```{r}
df2 <- obs_addtime(df)
```

Then we need a *key_time* to aggregate data.
This can be done using UTC, solar, or local time.
The normal approach is using afternoon solar or local time.


#### Hierarchy of solar or local time

1) Solar time
2) Local time with columns `site_utc2lst`
3) Local time longitude


> solar time (default)

Here we select the hours of interest and then
aggregate data by year, month and day of solar time.
In this way, we will have one information per day. however
this approach is not appropriate for aircraft
which are aggregated every 10 or 20 seconds. Hence
we need to aggregate data by one time column.
Also, this helps to generate the receptor info 
files including hour, minute and second.
Hence, *we need to add solar or local time column*.

```{r}
df2$solar_time <- obs_addstime(df2)

```


> local time with column `site_utc2lst`

Then we need to identify the local time with the function
`add_ltime`. This is important because to identifying
observations in the evening in local time.
`add_ltime` uses two methods, first identify
the time difference with utc by identifying the
metadata column "site_utc2lst". 
If solar time is not available
#now we need to cut solar time for the frequency needed. 
As we will work with 



> local time longitude

If this information
is not available, with the aircrafts for instance,
the local time is calculated with an approximation
based on longitude:


$$
lt = UTC + longitude/15 * 60 * 60
$$
Where $lt$ is the local time, $UTC$ the time,
$longitude$ the coordinate.
Then, the time is cut every two hours.
Now, we identify the local time to select evening hours.



#### Cut time

Now we have they key column time, we can cut it accordingly.

```{r}
df2$solar_time_cut <- cut(x = df2$solar_time,
                          breaks = "1 hour") |>
  as.character()

```


How we can check the solar time and the cut solar time.
Please note that solar_time_cut,
the column that it will be used to aggregate data

How we filter for the required solar time, in this case `r evening`. 

```{r}
df3 <- df2[hour_st %in% evening]
df3[, c("solar_time", "solar_time_cut")]


```




Now there are `r nrow(df3)` observations and before filtering
`r nrow(df2)`.
At this point we can calculate the averages of several columns by
the cut time. The function `obs_agg` does this aggregation as shown
in the following lines of code. The argument `gby`
establish the function used to aggregate `cols`. I need to aggregate the data
by date (year, month, date), because it is already filtered by
the hours of interest. Then, I would have 1 observation per day.

As standard, let us define `key_time` as `solar_time`. 
The `obs_agg` function will aggregate the desired data by that column.

```{r}
df3$key_time <- df3$solar_time_cut
```


```{r}
df4 <- obs_agg(dt = df3,
               cols = c("value",
                        "latitude",
                        "longitude",
                        "site_utc2lst"),
               verbose = T,
               byalt = TRUE)
```

Now there are `r nrow(df4)` observations,
`r nrow(df) - nrow(df4)` less observations.
Here we add the column `max_altitude` to identify the max altitude
by site. 

```{r}
df4[,
    max_altitude := max(altitude_final),
    by = site_code]
df4[,
    c("site_code",
      "altitude_final",
      "max_altitude")] |> unique()

```



## Master

Before generating the receptors list, we have the database with all the required information

```{r rename, eval = T}
master <- df4

```
We may replace missing values with a nine nines. Here is commented

#master[is.na(master)] <- 999999999

We transform the time variables to character and round coordinates with 4 digits

```{r round, eval = T}
master$timeUTC <- as.character(master$timeUTC)
master$local_time <- as.character(master$local_time)
master$latitude <- round(master$latitude, 4)
master$longitude <- round(master$longitude, 4)

```

## Save master
Finally we save the master file

```{r outfile, eval = T}
out <- tempfile()

```

### txt

```{r outtxt, eval = T}
message(paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".txt\n"))
fwrite(master,
       paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".txt"),
       sep = " ")

```

### csv

```{r outcsv, eval = T}
message(paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".csv\n"))
fwrite(master,
       paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".csv"),
       sep = ",")

```


### csvy

CSVY are csv files with a YAML header to include metadata in tabulated
text files

```{r csvy, eval = T}
cat("\nAdding notes in csvy:\n")
notes <- c(paste0("sector: ", datasetid),
           paste0("timespan: ", yy),
           paste0("spatial_limits: north = ", north, ", south = ", south, ", east = ", east, ", west = ", west),
           "data: Data averaged every 20 seconds",
           paste0("altitude: < ", max_altitude),
           paste0("hours: ", evening),
           "local_time: used solar_time")

cat(notes, sep = "\n")

message(paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".csvy\n"))
obs_write_csvy(dt = master,
               notes = notes,
               out = paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".csvy"))
```



```{r readcsvy, eval = T}
obs_read_csvy(paste0(out,"_", datasetid, ".csvy"))
```



## Receptors

Now we can do the last step which is generating the receptor list files.
Now we filter selected columns

```{r receptors, eval = T}
receptor <- master[, c("site_code",
                     "year",
                     "month",
                     "day",
                     "hour",
                     "minute",
                     "second",
                     "latitude",
                     "longitude",
                     "altitude_final",
                     "type_altitude",
                     "time_decimal")]

```

We can round altitude also

```{r round_alt, eval = T}
receptor$altitude_final <- round(receptor$altitude_final)
```

Now we can format time variables with two digits

```{r formatrec, eval = T}
receptor <- obs_format(receptor,
                        spf =  c("month", "day",
                                 "hour", "minute", "second"))
```

We have a column that indicate AGL or ASL

```{r aslagl, eval = T}
receptor_agl <- receptor[type_altitude == 0]
receptor_asl <- receptor[type_altitude == 1]
```

Finally, we save the receptors

```{r save_receptors, eval = T}
if(nrow(receptor_agl) > 0) {
  message(paste0(out, "_", datasetid, "_receptor_AGL.txt"), "\n")

  fwrite(x = receptor_agl,
         file = paste0(out, "_", datasetid, "_receptor_AGL.txt"),
         sep = " ")
}

if(nrow(receptor_asl) > 0) {
  message(paste0(out, "_", datasetid, "_receptor_ASL.txt"), "\n")

  fwrite(x = receptor_asl,
         file = paste0(out, "_", datasetid, "receptor_ASL.txt"),
         sep = " ")

}



```



## Plot

Finally, we just plot some data, run it locally


```{r obs_plotsave, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, eval = T, echo = F, message=F, warning=F}
png("../man/figures/obsplot_surfaceinsitu.png", width = 1500, height = 1000, res = 200)
obs_plot(df3, time = "timeUTC", yfactor = 1e9)
dev.off()
```

```{r obs_plot, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, eval = F}
obs_plot(df4, time = "timeUTC", yfactor = 1e9)
```
