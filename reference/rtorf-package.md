# rtorf: R Tools for Observations, Footprints and Receptors (rtorf) and HYSPLIT Configuration Tools

Provides a suite of tools to ingest, process, and visualize atmospheric
observation data, specifically tailored for the NOAA Global Monitoring
Laboratory (GML) ObsPack GLOBALView+ products
<https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/obspack/index.html>. Includes specialized
routines for filtering trace gas time-series data based on
meteorological and quality control parameters. Additionally, streamlines
the generation of configuration files for the Hybrid Single-Particle
Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model
<https://www.ready.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php>, supporting high-throughput
parallel processing of trajectory simulations.
